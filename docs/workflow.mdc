# X-Ray Delivery Workflow (Project)

1) Task Intake
- Confirm ADR/PRD exist; if not, create/update (ADR-001, PRD-xray-lite-v1).
- Identify if change impacts sampling/stats/query/storage; reference ADR-001.

2) Design & Documentation
- Update or add ADR/PRD before code; record key decisions in commit/PR notes.
- Define acceptance criteria from PRD section 6 for the work item.

3) Implementation
- Respect folder boundaries (SDK in `xray/`, API in `api/`, docs in `docs/`).
- Reference ADR/PRD in code comments where logic follows them.
- Default to non-blocking behavior; avoid cross-feature imports.

4) Verification
- Run targeted tests/demos (e.g., `python -m examples.competitor_selection`).
- Validate stats and sampling_summary behavior for large decision sets.
- Check linting on modified files; ensure queries return correct counts.

5) Review & Completion
- PR/summary must cite ADR-001 and PRD-xray-lite-v1.
- Note any deviations from PRD acceptance criteria with rationale.
- Update documentation if behavior or thresholds changed.
